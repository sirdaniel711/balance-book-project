# Balance Book Project

A balance book project built in Java. <br />
It is used to manage finances and keep track of bank accounts. This project is still a work-in-progress.

## Directions
- First, copy the Balance-Book folder.
- Then, use a console to navigate to the Balance-Book folder.
- Last, type "Java Value" followed by a space, then the current month and year in this format: MMYY

Example: typing "Java Value 0112" would open the file for January 2012 (or create a new file if that file does not exist yet). <br />
The files are saved in the Data folder.

This program can only edit one month at a time (one file at a time). Each month in a year is represented as a separate file.
